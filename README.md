## Description
This is the front for the Stage Oracle Project, 
Without the back-end, you will only be able to see the login page, register and the home page. \
The back-end is a two restful API's, what you can get from the following link:
https://github.com/Emilsivertsson/Stage-Oracle

## What was your motivation?
This is a part of my degree project for the course "Java integration" at Campus MÃ¶lndal. \
The project as whole is for Opera/theaters to manage their productions and performers. \
I wanted to create a front-end that is easy to use and that looks good, using React.

### Installation
To install the project, you need to have npm and node installed. \
Then you can clone the project and run the following commands in the terminal to install the dependencies. \
please note that you must be in the root folder of the project.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be running on localhost:3000

### OR 
You can visit the backend project linked above and use the Docker-compose file to run the whole project. \

## Usage
Open you favorite browser and go to localhost:3000. \

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
